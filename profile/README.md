<p>DAFT FM is a music website and organization dedicated to improving helping artists.</p>

<p>We believe that the true power of music comes from the creativity and passion of the artists who make it. That's why we've developed a range of tools and resources to help musicians focus on their craft and bring their unique visions to life to the largest audience possible.</p>

<p>We're just here to enjoy and help bring the best music to the world.</p>

<p>We're committed to using technology to empower artists and help them succeed - no matter how the landscape changes, because we believe that technology has an expiration date, but music is forever.</p>
